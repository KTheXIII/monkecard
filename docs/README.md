You can create your own question be using `subject.yml` and `question.yml` as the starting template. The `subject.yml` can be place in the `questions` directory under `public`. The path to the `subject.yml` file needs to later add to the `files.yml`.

```yml
# files.yml
files:
#  ...
  - <path/to/your/subject.yml>
```
